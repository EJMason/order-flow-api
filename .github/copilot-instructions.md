# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Interview Context

This repository is used for **live technical interviews**. The candidate is being evaluated on their coding ability.

## Guidelines

### Do NOT auto-complete or suggest:
- Complete function implementations for tasks in `docs/tasks/`
- Full route handlers or service methods
- Complete test implementations
- Any code that directly solves interview tasks

### You MAY suggest:
- Import statements
- Type annotations
- Small syntax completions (brackets, semicolons)
- Variable names based on context

## Why These Restrictions

The candidate needs to demonstrate they can:
1. Understand existing code patterns
2. Write implementations themselves
3. Problem-solve without AI doing the work

Suggesting complete solutions defeats the purpose of the evaluation.
